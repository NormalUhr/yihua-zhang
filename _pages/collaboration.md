# Collaboration Statement

I am always open to new and exciting collaborations in various areas of machine learning. Whether you are a fellow researcher, an industrial partner, or a student eager to dive into research, I look forward to working together on innovative projects.

#### Collaboration Opportunities for Peer Researchers and Industrial Partners

I am always open to collaborations with fellow researchers and industrial partners. While my primary research focuses on trustworthy and scalable ML algorithms for large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), I am interested in exploring a wide range of topics beyond these areas. If you have innovative ideas or are seeking to collaborate on cutting-edge research projects, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to exploring new possibilities and creating impactful advancements together.

#### Collaboration Opportunities for Undergraduate and Graduate Students

For undergraduate and junior graduate students interested in pursuing research or seeking Ph.D. opportunities, I am excited to provide professional guidance and mentorship. Over the past two years, I have mentored around 10 students, most of whom have published papers and secured Ph.D. positions at top universities around the world. I offer detailed guidance on idea exploration, experiment organization, results analysis, and paper writing, helping students quickly grow into professional and independent researchers. If you are interested in joining our OPTML lab, you are also welcome to email me to discuss potential opportunities.
