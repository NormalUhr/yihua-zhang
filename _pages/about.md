Yihua Zhang (张逸骅) is a third-year Ph.D. student at [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at Michigan State University, under the supervision of [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). His research centers on *trustworthy* and *scalable* machine learning (ML) algorithms for large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), with a keen focus on bridging theoretical foundations and real-world applications. In recognition of his outstanding contributions, Yihua was honored with the prestigious [MLCommons Rising Star Award in 2024](https://mlcommons.org/2024/06/2024-mlc-rising-stars/). Yihua has gained valuable industry experience through internships at leading technology companies such as [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/), [Amazon AWS AI Lab](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/), and [Cisco Research](https://research.cisco.com/). Yihua’s work is driven by the need to develop efficient, scalable, and robust ML algorithms, with a commitment to addressing modern challenges in these domains.
