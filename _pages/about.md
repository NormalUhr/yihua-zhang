I am Yihua Zhang (张逸骅), a first-year Ph.D. student from [OPTML Group](https://www.optml-group.com/) at Michigan State University, supervised by [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/). My research focuses on the *trustworthy* and *scalable ML* algorithms. In general, my research spans the areas of machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL), optimization theory, computer vision, and security. These research topics provide a solid foundation for my current and future research: Making AI system **safe** and **scalable**. My research on these two goals are intervened and can be summarized as the following two
perspectives:

:heavy_check_mark: **Algorithmic perspective**: This line of research designs the scalable and theoretically-grounded machine learning algorithms subject to real-life constraints, e.g., computation/communication overhead, robustness, fairness, and interpretability.

:heavy_check_mark: **Application perspective**: This line of research tackles the domain-specific challenges to achieve scalable and trustworthy AI, e.g., robustness enhancement, fairness promotion, data privacy protection, and model compression.
